üìÇ Kotlin Multiplatform library for Compose Multiplatform, designed for seamless integration of an image picker feature in iOS and Android applications.

## Getting started
[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.team-preat/peekaboo-image-picker?color=orange)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.github.mirzemehdi)

### Compose Multiplatform

As of version 0.1.1, `Peekaboo` is based on `Compose Multiplatform`, currently targeting only `iOS` and `Android`.
Please note that it primarily focuses on these platforms, and additional platforms may be considered in the future.
When using `Peekaboo` on Android, ensure that Google's Jetpack Compose version is compatible with Peekaboo's Compose Multiplatform version.
Presently, the only available artifact is `peekaboo-image-picker`, but the intention is to gradually expand the range of features and artifacts over time.

### Installation

The minimum supported Android SDK is 24 (Android 7.0).

Add `peekaboo` as a dependency to your project in `commonMain`. It's available on Maven Central.

```kotlin
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        implementation("io.github.team-preat:peekaboo-image-picker:$latest_version")
    }
}
```

You can just simply select the desired image.

### Select Multiple Images

```kotlin
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

val multipleImagePicker = rememberImagePickerLauncher(
    selectionMode = SelectionMode.Multiple,
    scope = scope,
    onResult = { byteArrays ->
        // Do something.
        println(byteArrays)
    }
)

Button(
    onClick = {
        multipleImagePicker.launch()
    }
) {
    Text("Pick Multiple Images")
}
```
