üìÇ Kotlin Multiplatform library for Compose Multiplatform, designed for seamless integration of an image picker feature in iOS and Android applications.

## Getting started
[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.team-preat/peekaboo-image-picker?color=orange)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.github.team-preat)

### Compose Multiplatform

`peekaboo` is based on `Compose Multiplatform`, currently targeting only `iOS` and `Android`.
Please note that it primarily focuses on these platforms, and additional platforms may be considered in the future.
When using `peekaboo` on Android, ensure that Google's Jetpack Compose version is compatible with Peekaboo's Compose Multiplatform version.
Presently, the only available artifact is `peekaboo-image-picker`, but the intention is to gradually expand the range of features and artifacts over time.

## Installation

The minimum supported Android SDK is 24 (Android 7.0).

In your `commonMain` configuration, add `peekaboo` as a dependency to your project. It's available on Maven Central.

### Without Version Catalog

```kotlin
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        implementation("io.github.team-preat:peekaboo-image-picker:$latest_version")
    }
}
```


### With Version Catalog

First, define the version in `libs.versions.toml`:

```toml
[versions]
peekaboo = "0.2.1"

[libraries]
peekaboo-image-picker = { module = "io.github.team-preat:peekaboo-image-picker", version.ref = "peekaboo" }
```

Then, in your `commonMain` configuration, reference the defined version:

```kotlin
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        implementation(libs.peekaboo.image.picker)
    }
}
```

| `peekaboo-image-picker` | Simplifies the process of selecting single or multiple images in `iOS` and `Android` apps. |
| `peekaboo-camera-picker` | üöß Coming soon! A convenient way to capture and select images directly from cameras on iOS and Android. üì∏ |

## Usage
### Select Single Image

```kotlin
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

val singleImagePicker = rememberImagePickerLauncher(
    selectionMode = SelectionMode.Single,
    scope = scope,
    onResult = { byteArrays ->
        byteArrays.firstOrNull()?.let {
            // Process the selected images' ByteArrays.
            println(it)
        }
    }
)

Button(
    onClick = {
        singleImagePicker.launch()
    }
) {
    Text("Pick Single Image")
}
```

Simply select the desired image with an intuitive interface.

### Select Multiple Images

If you want to select multiple images, you can use `SelectionMode.Multiple()`. And you can set the maximum number of images to select.
If you didn't set max selection, the default value is maximum number that the system supports.

```kotlin
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

val multipleImagePicker = rememberImagePickerLauncher(
    // Optional: Set a maximum selection limit, e.g., SelectionMode.Multiple(maxSelection = 5).
    // Default: No limit, depends on system's maximum capacity.
    selectionMode = SelectionMode.Multiple(maxSelection = 5),
    scope = scope,
    onResult = { byteArrays ->
        byteArrays.forEach {
            // Process the selected images' ByteArrays.
            println(it)
        }
    }
)

Button(
    onClick = {
        multipleImagePicker.launch()
    }
) {
    Text("Pick Multiple Images")
}
```

## ByteArray to ImageBitmap Conversion
We've added a new extension function `toImageBitmap()` to convert a `ByteArray` into an `ImageBitmap`.
This function simplifies the process of converting image data into a displayable format, enhancing the app's capability to handle image processing efficiently.

### Usage
```kotlin
val imageBitmap = byteArray.toImageBitmap()
```
